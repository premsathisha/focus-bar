## Why I'm working on this

Staying focused shouldn’t be complicated. That’s why I’m building this Pomodoro timer as a simple, distraction-free tool that just works, with no accounts, no subscriptions, and no need to touch your phone. It’s based on my own needs and built to be something I use every day.
