## About the project

Focus Bar was built as a personal productivity tool to keep work sessions structured and distraction-free. It runs entirely in the menu bar, requires no sign-in, and has no unnecessary features. By eliminating the need to interact with a phone, it reduces potential distractions and helps maintain focus. The goal was to create something minimal, fast, and reliable that could be used daily without configuration.
